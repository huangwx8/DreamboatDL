# NumPy-Neural-Networks

A deep learning package implemented using NumPy, which includes commonly used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, common loss functions like MSE, BCE, and CrossEntropyWithLogits, as well as frequently used network modules such as linear layers, 2D convolution layers, 2D pooling layers, RNN layers, BatchNorm1d layers, embedding layers, and upsampling layers.

The code style is inspired by PyTorch, with implementation details more similar to Keras.

In addition to the library itself, there are several simple examples provided, such as image recognition for MNIST and CIFAR, character-level sequence recognition, Word2Vec, image segmentation, GANs, reinforcement learning, and more.
